# Workflowy daily page based on date selection 
In workflowy it is not possible to have a daily page. Now my idea is to create a chrome extension that facilitates this just like other apps are doing it. 

## create a two pane window where workflowy is embeded. 
- In the left pane the default workflowy page
- In the right pane the current day selected and expanded.


## Example data:
Use this link to see the structure of the dates and figure out how to select the current day.
